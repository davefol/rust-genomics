# Rust Genomics

## About
rust-genomics is a general purpose genetics and genomics library aimed at researchers who want to leverage the powerful Rust language to do research and build tools for other researchers.

This is not necessarily a toolset for exploratory analysis, I believe that there are better packages for that. This library is for when you want to build a rock solid and fast pipeline or tool.
